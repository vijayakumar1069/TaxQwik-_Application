          In the complex world of taxes, having a safety net is crucial. That’s
          where audit support comes into play. This service provides you with
          professional assistance in the event of a tax audit by the Canada
          Revenue Agency (CRA). But what happens if you choose not to opt for
          audit support? Let’s delve into the importance of audit support and
          our policy to protect ourselves if you decide against it.

          Audit support is like an insurance policy for your tax return. It
          offers peace of mind, knowing that if the CRA decides to review your
          tax return, you have a team of professionals ready to assist you. They
          can help you understand the audit process, prepare necessary
          documents, and even represent you in discussions with the CRA.

          While we strongly recommend our audit support service, we understand
          that some clients may choose to opt out. If you decide against audit
          support, it’s important to understand the implications. You will be
          solely responsible for handling any inquiries or audits by the CRA.
          This includes understanding the audit notice, gathering required
          documents, and communicating with the CRA.

          To protect our firm, we have a policy in place for clients who opt out
          of audit support. We will provide the tax return service as agreed,
          but any additional work required due to an audit will incur separate
          charges. This includes consultations, document preparation, and any
          communication with the CRA on your behalf.
